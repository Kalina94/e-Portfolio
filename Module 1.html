												Overall this was a good attempt at the induction assignment, which has earned you a pass mark. Please see below some general feedback which I hope you find useful.
												
												Quality of written expression & presentation (Pass)
												Your writing has been fairly well presented with a suitable introduction into the importance of a postgraduate degree in computer science. You have demonstrated a fairly good level of English with a few errors. Always spell check and proofread your work before submitting it for marking. The ideas presented in the main body of your essay have been suitably discussed with some evidence of critical analysis. This then leads to a conclusion where you highlight your expectations for the course and provide your final thoughts on this topic. Moving forward please note that you should usually use the third person in academic writing and not use the first person (unless it is a reflective assignment or requires your personal experience). So by this I mean you need to avoid using "I", "we" and "me" etc.
												
												Follows instructions (Pass)
												• Addresses the set question
												• Shows good understanding
												• Meets the word count
												
												Overall you have generally addressed the various points from the assignment question demonstrating a good level of understanding of the specific requirements of this task. You have also met the word count of 750 (+10%). Your essay was 675 words (excluding the references list) and the maximum allowed word count was 825. As you begin your studies it is important to always aim to use the full number of words allowed in an assessment as this provides you the scope to demonstrate more of your critical analysis and deeper understanding of the topic.
												
												Academic integrity & wider reading (Pass)
												You have utilised a few suitable sources to support your analysis of this topic. There is some evidence of your understanding of the requirements of an academic writing style.

												In-text citations have been correctly incorporated into the body of your writing and you have included a references list where you have attempted to use the Harvard referencing format. There were a few errors, for example, you do not need to number your references and the year should be in brackets. Please review the UoE Harvard referencing guidelines.

												The Turnitin report indicated a match of 0% (excluding the matches contained within your list of references at the end), which is fine. As indicated in the academic resources (see the Harvard Referencing Guide provided in Moodle), we advise students to limit the amount of correctly attributed text to 10% - 15% of the main body of their report.

												As you start your subject modules I would advise you to continue to utilise the UoE library resources and/or Google Scholar to search for academically credible sources (journals, peer-reviewed texts and academic textbooks) that you can refer to as supporting evidence in your future assessments. It is always advisable to avoid unreliable, non peer-reviewed sources, such as internet blogs, Wikipedia, essay repository sites and so on as these are really not appropriate to use in academic writing at this level.

										<h2 class="major">Reflections</h2>
										<p> Following this module, I have been able to: </p>
										<ul>
										
										<li> Develop my skills of reflective learning and critical thinking </li>
										<li> Enhancing my knowledge of referencing and the avoidance of academic dishonesty </li>
										<li> Acknowledge the skills required for successful completion of future modules (including academic writing and research skills) </li>
										</ul>
										
										The module as a whole has enabled me to look further into my future post in my career itself, since I had the opportunity to reflect on the importance of a postgraduate degree in Computer Science. Furthermore, through the academic writing, I was able to be analytical and learn to have a strong opinion through it. It has enabled me to see the perspectives of different aspects and form an opinion on it according to the information available. Career wise, during a meeting, I was able to explain complex situation in simpler terms.
