											<h2 class="modal-header">Feedback Obtained</h2>
											<div class="content">
											The report is well written with providing detailed benefits to be derived from ASMIS when installed. You employed the STRIDE modelling technique to identify potential vulnerabilities. The components of the STRIDE technique are well explained. The UML diagrams employed clearly demonstrate how each of the threat identified is likely to manifest. Firewall, encryption, 2 factor-authentication and login management are proposed as potential solutions to the attacks.
												
											The report could benefit from critical evaluation of the proposed solutions. The advantages were mentioned but it would be to also point out some disadvantages associated with the solutions as well. It is unclear how some of the attacks identified by the STRIDE technique were being addressed. An example is the Repudiation. Also, firewall was mentioned as a possible solution. However, it remains unclear the type of firewall being proposed. It is also unclear why “person” class and the “doctor” class are connected in the class diagram. The doctor has no direct interaction with the person. There references used in the report could better as they heavily relied on non-peer-reviewed articles and blogs. Also you have your word-count is excessively high above the acceptable margin.
												
											Overall, some good work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted above.  </br></br>

											<div class="content">
												<b> Knowledge and understanding of the topic/ issues under consideration: 40% </b> </br>
												The code has an implementation of a solution to mitigate false login attacks. The solution is an implementation of a one-time password (OTPs) using a 2FA  technology. The implementation employed  Python,  python-based Flask framework and Twilio API.  The use of these technologies to secure user login details is well justified. </br>
												
											<b>	Application of knowledge and understanding: 30% </b> </br>
												
												Even though documentation was clear to follow and the implementation logic was sound, the implementation did not ensure good password and username policies. For example, minimum length the format of acceptable passwords. These would have strengthened the security further and criticality of your assessment of the security and implementation strategy. </br>
												
											<b>	Structure and Presentation (as detailed in the assessment guidance): 30% </b> </br>
												
												There is a very good documentation of functionality and lines of code. The README file is informative with information on tests carried out and the outputs from tests.  You demonstrated some degree of criticality in your analysis and presentation of the proposed solution. </br></br>
