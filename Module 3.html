											<b>		Knowledge: </b> A good assessment of the proposed 'challenge' - I particularly enjoyed the use of secondary sources to back up your assumptions. Good work in the forum posts as well. <br>

											<b>	Application of Knowledge: </b> Your mixture of risks and assumptions demonstrates a good application of the subject material. I also appreciated the breakdown of the risks by option - another good application of knowledge <br>

											<b>Criticality:</b>  The use of secondary sources demonstrates a critical approach to the material and challenge - good work. <br>

											<b>Structure & presentation: </b>I enjoyed the use of a tabular approach - a very good way to get a lot of information presented succinctly. However you still exceeded the word limit - which is a pity and were unfortunately penalised for it. You also failed to provide any form of timeline/ plan which was a written requirement and so lost all the marks for that section. There were also a few very obvious typos. Consider using more diagrams and illustrations which can help with keeping word count down.  </br></br>

											You made a good effort in this report but it seemed somewhat rushed. It lacked sources/ background data/ research and really need some numbers to support your recommendations. <br>

											It was good that you provided a comparison and evaluation of risks but it was unclear what your recommendation was. Also your DR solution was well-argued but unfortunately, it did not meet the requirements provided in the assessment. <br>

											Consider using sources both to provide you with data as well as introducing alternative viewpoints to support your case.<br>											 

											This report still had several easily spotted and checked typos and errors. Consider employing a buddy system where you each check each others work. </br></br>

												<b> Knowledge and understanding of the topic/ issues under consideration: 40% </b> </br>
												The code has an implementation of a solution to mitigate false login attacks. The solution is an implementation of a one-time password (OTPs) using a 2FA  technology. The implementation employed  Python,  python-based Flask framework and Twilio API.  The use of these technologies to secure user login details is well justified. </br>
												
											<b>	Application of knowledge and understanding: 30% </b> </br>
												
												Even though documentation was clear to follow and the implementation logic was sound, the implementation did not ensure good password and username policies. For example, minimum length the format of acceptable passwords. These would have strengthened the security further and criticality of your assessment of the security and implementation strategy. </br>
												
											<b>	Structure and Presentation (as detailed in the assessment guidance): 30% </b> </br>
												
												There is a very good documentation of functionality and lines of code. The README file is informative with information on tests carried out and the outputs from tests.  You demonstrated some degree of criticality in your analysis and presentation of the proposed solution. </br></br>

										<h2 class="major">Reflections</h2>
										<p> For the group assignments of this module, I was paired with Keir. Beig from two different time zone, did not affect our determination for the course. We find ways to establish our comminication and discussion of the coursework. Following the first group assignment's feedback we proposed a well planned methodology to monitor the next assignment's progression. Personally, this module enabled me to enhance my collaborative and communication skills.</p>

										<p>This module has helped me to reflect on and evaluate personal development. I mostly enculcated the skills gained during the group work and used them efficiently at work. In my professional team, I was praised about my efficient collaborative and newly developped leadership skills. I plan to work on my leadership skills which will surely help me in my future position.</p>
