											A good report, well thought out and well supported by references and diagrams. As a development point consider adding both design patterns as well as anti-patterns to avoid – it can make development easier. Also, good attention to punctuation, defining abbreviations and referencing. </br> </br>
											
											The domain-specific requirements are presented before the group tells the reader what they are proposing to do. I would like to see a section on the proposed solution before domain-specific requirements are discussed. At the end of this section, a reference has been included to Hillenius (2013); it is not clear what exactly this source is supporting.</br></br>
											
											I like that this group has given attention to the assignment of user roles.</br></br>
											
											Figures numbered and labelled - effective attention to detail and presentation.</br></br>
											
											A detailed sequence diagram is presented. It would be natural to assume that a class diagram would be presented before the sequence diagram, as it is the class/object information that is used to create the class diagram.</br></br>
											
											I like that the authors present the challenges with the design and development of the system after discussing the system design. I would like to see the solutions section presented before the proposed design, as it might be expected that this information will influence the way in which the system is being designed.</br></br>
											
											Good reference list.

										<h2 class="major">Reflections</h2>
										<p> For the group assignments of this module, I was initially grouped with Marzio, Sebastian and Keir. But, about halfway through the group assignment, we learned of Keir's decision to drop out. Also, being from different time zones, did not affect our determination for the course, all the tasks were well-defined and distributed according to our expertise and technical skills. Our communication tools were both WhatsApp and Google Meet. We established three key rules for our team to follow: first, each member will be assigned to a specific task; second, each team member will be given the opportunity to host a meeting; and third, the deadline for submitting the draft for peer review should be adhered to as much as possible. Nonetheless, since we are all professionals, we were lenient with the third rule. Our team's greatest strength is that it is highly cooperative, well-organized, and respectful of each team member's personal and professional responsibilities. Following Design Proposal Report feedback which claimed that several sections were misplaced in the report, we drafted all the sections which would need to be mentioned in the README file of the Coding Output and posted it on the Trello platform to closely supervise its structure.  Personally, this module enabled me to enhance my collaborative and leadership skills.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Professional skills matrix and action plan</h2>
										<p>This module has helped me to reflect on and evaluate personal development. I mostly enculcated the collaborative skills gained during the group work and used them efficiently in my professional team. At work, I was praised, by both my team leader and manager about my efficient collaborative skills as I am contributing immensely to the production team of the company. Followiing this group assignment, I plan to work on my organisational skills which will surely help me in my current and future position.</p>
