											A good report, well thought out and well supported by references and diagrams. As a development point consider adding both design patterns as well as anti-patterns to avoid – it can make development easier. Also, good attention to punctuation, defining abbreviations and referencing. </br> </br>
											
											The domain-specific requirements are presented before the group tells the reader what they are proposing to do. I would like to see a section on the proposed solution before domain-specific requirements are discussed. At the end of this section, a reference has been included to Hillenius (2013); it is not clear what exactly this source is supporting.</br></br>
											
											I like that this group has given attention to the assignment of user roles.</br></br>
											
											Figures numbered and labelled - effective attention to detail and presentation.</br></br>
											
											A detailed sequence diagram is presented. It would be natural to assume that a class diagram would be presented before the sequence diagram, as it is the class/object information that is used to create the class diagram.</br></br>
											
											I like that the authors present the challenges with the design and development of the system after discussing the system design. I would like to see the solutions section presented before the proposed design, as it might be expected that this information will influence the way in which the system is being designed.</br></br>

											<a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=255905" target="_blank"> → Collaborative Discussion 1 <br></a> <p> My initial discussion was based onto <u> Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth)</u>, which focused on the challenges faced by the Food and Drug Administration in identifying medical device failures from deliberate or malicious activities are discussed in this paper, as well as the fact that existing policies and procedures are insufficient in light of the actual security threats that exist. The results of the attacks were monitored, captured and inspected to ascertain the impact on the device. The controlling medical mannequin's computer was also monitored to see if it provided any indications that there was something wrong. The main risk was that the impact of a successful attack on a training facility could go undetected and yet influence training classes of medical professionals to incorrectly assess situations based on inaccurate feedback from medical devices. The authors note that the attacks acknowledged are similar to that of identification with the addition of medical identity theft and denial of service. </p>
										
											<h5 style="color: black;">Peer response: </h5> The traffic between zones must be well defined hence providing the ability to block and prevent illegal communications. It must be assumed that successful breaches against unpatched biomedical systems are likely to be able to subvert the controls provided by any software firewall in that operating system. Medical hardware should be installed in network zones that reduce the traffic which can reach them. Access such zones should only be granted to only clients that must communicate with medical hardware in those zones. <br><br>
