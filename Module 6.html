							<h2>The Human Factor </h2>
							<p>Humans are the inventors and designers of technologies that drive information systems and are also responsible for the security of these systems. The revolution of the internet and the ever-changing landscape of the Cyberworld are putting human behaviour at the core of matters related to Cyber Security.</p>

											<div class="content">
											Overall, some good work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted below.  </br> </br>
											
											<b> Knowledge and understanding </b> </br>
											You demonstrate some degree of knowledge and understanding of the human factors, highlighting the need for flexibility focusing on the interface design of ASMIS. While these factors can improve user experience, there is however lack of clarity on the factors discussed in relation to the security of ASMIS. </br></br>
																					
											<b> Criticality </b> </br>
											While you demonstrate some degree of criticality in the discussion, particularly having the system to prevent ‘no-show’ appointment as it is a source of potential loss of time and resources, this may not be strictly a cyber security issue, as this is possible in every system including manual bookings. </br></br>
											
											<b> Use of relevant sources </b> </br>
											Some relevant sources have been provided to support discussion which is good to see.</br></br>
											
											<b> Structure and presentation  </b> </br>
											As already indicated, the focus of the essay could be better.  </br></br>
											
											<b> Academic integrity </b> </br>
											Limited references have been provided to support discussion which is not enough and does not demonstrate wider reading.  </br></br>

											 I had to provide review comments on two essays essays. Each review should demonstrate critical appreciation of the issues raised.

											<i> Distinction: </i> A great selection of tools and presentation of data - obviously demonstrating your understanding of the techniques. </br> </br>
											
											<i> Merit: </i> A very good technical section and discussion of potential vulnerabilities - let down by later interpretation and analysis of results. 		</br> </br>						

											<i> Merit: </i> A good selection of references and discussion of e-health issues criticality - but you missed the chance to discuss the failings of some indicators such as CVSS.</br> </br>

											<i> Pass: </i> A very good initial technical section was let down by poor grammar and unclear interpretation of results. It almost read like a report of two (or three) parts - needed a final proofread. </br> </br>

											The final assessment in this module, I had to present the solutions to the issues identified in the first assessment, including social and ethical considerations. The assignment required a recorded presentation of 10 minutes, along with a transcript of the audio file.<br> <br>

											<h2 class="modal-header">Feedback Obtained</h2>
											<div class="content">
											
											<b> Knowledge and understanding (merit)</b> <br>

											You demonstrate some degree of knowledge and understanding of the human factors, highlighting various factors including flexibility in appointment scheduling, staff phishing emails and patients risk categorisation. While some of the issues identified and solutions proposed could help improve user experience, these are not in the context of cyber security except the staff phishing emails. Although, the Least Privilege Principle solution proposed and the justification around that could be considered. It is also unclear how the solution outlined would be evaluated and measured to ensure continuous improvement. A brief discussion around this would been excellent.<br><br>

											<b> Criticality (merit)</b> <br>

											You demonstrate some degree of criticality in discussing the measures and how these can be employed. For example, your point about 24% of doctors unable to spot phishing emails and relating that to the fact that doctors have the most privileged access to ASMIS which puts sensitive data at risk is very good. However, it would been excellent to also mention the patients in the discussion of the solutions as they are also users of ASMIS.<br><br>

											<b> Use of relevant sources (merit)</b> <br>

											There is evidence of wider reading and consultation of relevant sources as shown in thorough the presentation which is very good. Also, excellent use of sources and well referenced throughout the presentation.<br><br>

											<b> Presentation and Communication Skills (merit)</b> <br>

											Very good presentation and communication skills. Very clear message and good use of visual aids to aid the communication of the content. You employed good communication techniques to carry the audience along.<br><br>

											<b> Structure and presentation (merit)</b> <br>

											Very good structure and presentation. Slides are well easy to follow with good visuals. The beginning of the presentation gave a clear context for the audience.									 </br></br>

										<h2 class="major">Reflections</h2>
										<p> Following this module, I have been able to: </p>
										<ul>
										
										<li> Develop an understanding of the security issues and risks associated with how people interact with computing systems</li>
										<li> Develop the knowledge and skills required to manage and mitigate cyber risks in socio-technical systems </li>
								
										</ul>
										
										The module as a whole has equipped with the knowledge and skills required to be able to design usable security solutions. Also, the theories, concepts and principles from behavioural psychological and computer science to explore how effective usable security solutions can be designed, are explored in this module.

										<h2 class="major">Professional skills matrix and action plan</h2>
										<p>This module has helped me to improve my presentation and communication skills, to the point that I can now express my ideas smoothly during a formal meeting with clients. It has also enhanced my technique of examining effective strategies for promoting and managing the human factor in cyber security, as well as the process of evaluating social and ethical concerns in creating and deploying useable security. I intend to improve my ability to manage and mitigate cyber risks in socio-technical systems, since this will undoubtedly benefit me in my future position. </p>
