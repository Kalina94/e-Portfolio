							<h2>Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law </h2>
							<p>The central consideration of this module is the need to be aware of common legal principles which apply to Cyberspace, to provide a solid foundation in ethics, rights and regulatory challenges which can be applied to a range of situations and jurisdictions, common legal principles which apply to forensics and expert evidence, and to provide a solid foundation in evidence gathering and analysis which can be applied to a range of situations and jurisdictions. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Reflections</h2>
										<p> Following this module, I have been able to: </p>
										<ul>
										
										<li> Introduce the foundational legal concepts and terminologies relevant to digital forensics, with an emphasis on evidence and proof</li>
										<li> Outline the relevant global legal and regulatory environment, including the GDPR and the obligations it imposes </li>
										<li> Discuss cyber harms and digital rights </li>
										<li> Introduce ethics in cyber work</li>
										<li> Examine the challenges and opportunities of regulating and policing cyberspace </li>
										<li> Explain different types of evidence and evidence collection and the underlying principles of verifiability, continuity and presentation </li>
										<li> Examine the range of investigations cybersecurity professionals carry out and the challenges of investigation </li>
										</ul>
										
										
										The module as a whole has enabled me to explore the challenges and opportunities of regulating and policing cyberspace and to critically evaluate different types of evidence and collection and presentation techniques, underpinned by the principles of continuity of evidence and reliability of analytical tools and techniques.

										<h2 class="major">Professional skills matrix and action plan</h2>
										<p>This module has helped me to improve my presentation and communication skills, to the point that I can now evaluate different types of evidence and collection, underpinned by the principles of continuity of evidence and reliability of analytical tools and techniques smoothly during a formal meeting with clients. It has also enhanced my technique of appraising ethical considerations and the rights that people may or may not have in cyberspace, as well as the global legal and regulatory environment as it applies to cyberspace, and compliance requirements, including the GDPR and the obligations it imposes. I intend to improve my ability to exploring the challenges and opportunities of regulating and policing cyberspace , since this will undoubtedly benefit me in my future position. </p>
